                <h1>Content Submission Guidelines</h1>
                <p>I'm thrilled that you're interested in contributing to Shane Studios! To ensure all submissions are high-quality, safe, and respectful of the community, please adhere to the following guidelines.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guidelines-content">
                <h2>General Rules for All Submissions</h2>
                <p>These rules are non-negotiable and apply to both Article and Community submissions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Malicious Content:</strong> Submissions must not contain viruses, malware, trackers, or any code intended to cause harm to a user's device or data. All submissions will be reviewed in a sandboxed environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Plagiarism or AI-Generated Content:</strong> All submitted content, whether code or text, must be your own original work or properly attributed if based on an existing open-source project. Submissions found to be generated by AI language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) will be rejected. The goal is to share genuine human creativity and knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respectful and Inclusive:</strong> Content must not be defamatory, hateful, or discriminatory. We aim to build a positive and welcoming community for everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Submissions should be relevant to the themes of this website: web development, creative coding, software design, and technology.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Article Submissions</h2>
                <p>If you are submitting a full-length article, please ensure it meets these additional criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clarity and Depth:</strong> Articles should be well-written, clear, and provide genuine insight or educational value on a specific topic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Accuracy:</strong> All code examples must be functional and demonstrate the concepts described in the article.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Aid:</strong> Please include at least one high-quality image, diagram, or screenshot that helps illustrate the article's main point. This could be a screenshot of the final project, a helpful diagram, or a relevant visual metaphor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structure and Formatting:</strong> Your article should be structured with clear headings, paragraphs, and code blocks. To make this easy, you can download a template with the required files and styling.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="download-container">
                    <a href="/article.zip" download class="action-button download-button">
                        <i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> Download Article Template (.zip)
                    </a>
                </div>
                <h2>Community Submissions</h2>
                <p>Community submissions are for smaller pieces of content, like code snippets, cool effects, or interesting programming concepts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus and Functionality:</strong> The submission should be a self-contained, working example. If it's a code snippet, it should be clear what it does and how to use it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Include a Screenshot/GIF:</strong> Please provide a screenshot or, even better, a short animated GIF showing your submission in action. This is crucial for the preview on the snippets page.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Serious" Jokes and Pranks are Welcome:</strong> While submissions must be serious in their implementation (i.e., not broken code), joke submissions are allowed if they are clever, funny, and harmless. A "chaotic button" that runs away from the cursor is a great example. A script that infinitely opens `alert()` dialogs is not. The key is creative fun, not user annoyance.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to Submit Your Content</h2>
                <p>Due to email security restrictions that block many file types, including `.zip` and `.js`, you cannot attach your submission directly to the email.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use a Trusted File Hosting Service:</strong> Please upload your submission (ideally as a `.zip` file containing all code and images) to a trusted service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or a private GitHub repository.</li>
                    <li><strong>Share the Link:</strong> In your submission email, provide a public, shareable link to your file. Ensure that link permissions are set so that anyone with the link can view and download the content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Include a Description:</strong> In the body of your email, please include a brief description of your submission, what it does, and why you think it would be a good fit for Shane Studios. If you wish to be credited, please state the name and optional social link you'd like to use.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All submissions are reviewed manually. I cannot guarantee that all submissions will be published, but I will do my best to provide feedback where possible. Thank you for your contribution!</p>
