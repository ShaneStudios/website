                <h1>Suggestion Guidelines</h1>
                <p>I'm always looking for new ways to improve Shane Studios and my projects. Your ideas and suggestions are a vital part of that process. To help me understand your vision, please follow these guidelines when submitting a suggestion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guidelines-content">
                <h2>The Anatomy of a Great Suggestion</h2>
                <p>A helpful suggestion clearly explains the "what," the "why," and the "how." It moves beyond a simple idea to a well-reasoned proposal.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identify the Problem or Opportunity:</strong> Start by explaining the problem you're trying to solve or the opportunity you see. For example, instead of "add a search bar," try "It's difficult to find specific snippets; a search bar on the Snippets page would help."</li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the Proposed Solution:</strong> Clearly describe your suggested feature or improvement. What would it do? How would it work from a user's perspective?</li>
                    <li><strong>Explain the Benefit:</strong> Why would this be a good change? Explain how your suggestion would improve the user experience, add value, or make the site more useful for you and others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> The more detail you can provide, the better. If you have an idea for how a feature should look or behave, please describe it. Mockups or sketches are welcome but not required.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What Kind of Suggestions Are Welcome?</h2>
                <p>I'm open to a wide range of ideas. Feel free to suggest things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Website Features:</strong> Ideas for new pages, sections, or interactive elements (e.g., "a dark/light mode toggle," "a comment section for articles").</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvements to Existing Features:</strong> Suggestions on how to make a current feature better (e.g., "add syntax highlighting options to the RyxIDE demo," "the article filters should remember my choice").</li>
                    <li><strong>New Content Ideas:</strong> Topics for new articles, projects, or code snippets you'd like to see.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usability and Accessibility Improvements:</strong> Feedback on how to make the site easier to use for everyone, including those with disabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What Happens After You Submit?</h2>
                <p>Every suggestion is read and considered carefully. While I can't promise that every idea will be implemented, here is the general process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Review:</strong> I will review your suggestion to understand the core problem and the proposed solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> I'll evaluate the feasibility, potential impact, and how it aligns with the overall vision for Shane Studios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Viable suggestions are added to a backlog of potential features and prioritized for future development.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Due to the volume of suggestions, I may not be able to provide a personal response to every email, but please know that your input is greatly appreciated and plays a direct role in shaping the future of this site. Thank you for helping me build a better platform!</p>
